Description: This package is developed based on the R package `mkin`.
    It is used by the KinGUI v2.1. The package is used to determine
    kinetic parameters from results of environmental fate studies,
    e.g. aerobic soil degradation, by fitting respective kinetic
    models to the observed data.The package allows the choice
    between different optimization algorithms. In particular the
    estimation of parameter confidence intervals is much
    improved/corrected as compared to other commonly used
    evaluation softwares by providing the methods Iteratively
    Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
    (MCMC).
